abstract: " The international community is exploring many potential end uses for polymer
  additive manufacturing. However, significant issues must be addressed before broad
  application can occur, in particular understanding the relationships between materials,
  processes, and final part properties. Key to these issues is having reliable test
  methods to measure properties of interest.\nThis work used an AON-M2 industrial
  printer to investigate material extrusion manufacturing. Past research has frequently
  shown interlayer weld strength (i.e., Z-direction strength) is the weakest property
  in material extrusion parts and has also shown this property is difficult to measure,
  with significant data scatter and poor failure modes common for tensile specimens
  printed vertically. Using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, the current work investigated
  in-plane shear testing to interrogate interlayer weld strength based on ASTM D3846,
  Standard Test Method for In-Plane Shear Strength of Reinforced Plastics, which uses
  a notched coupon loaded in compression. Further, a modified version of ASTM D3846
  was investigated using smaller unnotched “minishear coupons.” Both test methods
  were found to provide very consistent results, with coefficients of variation of
  5% or less; however, the ASTM D3846 notched coupons showed evidence of excessive
  gage section rotation and interference with the test fixture. The minishear test
  method did not have this problem and also allowed direct measurement of strain,
  thereby providing shear modulus.\nThe authors note that in assessing the effect
  of process on properties, choice of the basis of comparison is important. While
  many researchers use injection molded properties, the authors believe this is misleading
  because the injection molding process itself affects properties. Instead, the authors
  investigated measurement of the polymer filament directly. New methods for filament
  shear and tension testing were developed that provided good coefficients of variation
  and allowed direct comparison between three-dimensional printed coupon properties
  and filament properties in shear. "
