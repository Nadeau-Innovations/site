 abstract = {This paper presents a closed-loop calibration approach
using impedance control. The process is managed by a data
communication architecture based on open-source tools and
designed for adaptability. The calibration procedure uses
precision spheres and a kinematic coupling standard machine
tool components, which are suitable for harsh industrial
environments. As such, the required equipment is low cost
(approximately $2000 USD), robust, and is quick to set up,
especially when compared to traditional calibration
devices. As demonstrated through an experimental study and
validated with a laser tracker, the absolute accuracy of
the KUKA LBR iiwa robot was improved to a maximum error of
0.990 mm, representing a 58.4% improvement when compared to
the nominal model. Further testing showed that a
traditional calibration using a laser tracker only improved
the maximum error by 58 &micro;m over the impedance control
approach.},
