abstract: Modern robotic programming relies on offline simulation to reduce process
  downtime. In a virtual environment, application specialists can program, visualize,
  and test their robotic application before deploying it to the real production environment.
  This offline process saves both time and costs while increasing the safety and efficacy
  of the robotic application. [`Pybotics`](https://github.com/engnadeau/pybotics)
  is an open-source Python toolbox for robot kinematics and calibration. It was designed
  to provide a simple, clear, and concise interface to quickly simulate and evaluate
  common robot concepts, such as kinematics, dynamics, trajectory generations, and
  calibration.
