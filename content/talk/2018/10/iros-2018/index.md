abstract: Given that the success of an interaction task depends on the capability
  of the robot system to handle physical contact with its environment, pure motion
  control is often insufficient. This is especially true in the context of medical
  freehand ultrasound where the human body is a deformable surface and an unstructured
  environment, representing both a safety concern and a challenge for trajectory planning
  and control. The systematic tuning of practical high degree-of-freedom physical
  human-robot interaction (pHRI) tasks is not trivial and there are many parameters
  to be tuned. While traditional tuning is generally performed ad hoc and requires
  knowledge of the robot and environment dynamics, we propose a simple and effective
  online tuning framework using differential evolution (DE) to optimize the motion
  parameters for parallel force/impedance control in a pHRI and medical ultrasound
  motion application. Through real-world experiments with a KUKA LBR iiwa 7 R800 collaborative
  robot, the DE framework tuned motion control for optimal and safe trajectories along
  a human leg phantom. The optimization process was able to successfully reduce the
  mean absolute error of the motion contact force to 0.537 N through the evolution
  of eight motion control parameters.
