title: Partnership Between Pivot + Edge and Nadeau Innovations
---

You need incredible teams to build incredible innovation. ðŸš€

But building high-performance teams is a top challenge that startups face. We all want top talent from day one but often need more credibility or process to capture those hard-to-get superstars.

[John Fleischauer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bigtalljohn/) and [Pivot + Edge](https://www.pivotandedge.com/) have been my secret weapons in growing incredible tech teams across several startups.

That's why I'm excited to announce the collaboration and partnership between Pivot + Edge and Nadeau Innovations!

At Nadeau Innovations, we help companies build next-generation technologies and empower high-performance teams. With Pivot + Edge, we're taking it to the next level by making startup hiring simpler and more effective with their smart, simple, scalable startup hiring solutions.

Early-stage startups can leverage Pivot + Edge to craft the employer brand, help with the hiring process, and grow the team immediately with more people like your best people.

Focus on your product, customers, and talent, not on the overhead.
