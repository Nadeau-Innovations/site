> “Our mission is to build humanoid robots that will change the world and solve the labour shortage,” says Nicholas Nadeau, CTO of Halodi Robotics. “The humanoid form factor is not simply a design choice; we believe it is the only choice for a system that needs to interact with the human world.”

> "One of the reasons I chose Montreal as our North American headquarters was to leverage the multitude of different disciplines that we have available, not only AI, not only robotics, but video gaming as well," adds Nadeau.

> "Montreal is a significant location for some of the important AI sub-sectors for robotics. Deep learning, reinforcement learning and computer vision - Montreal has really strong capabilities in those - and Montreal has always been an aeronautics hub. Our robots aren't necessarily actually humanoid things walking around. They could be a million different things such as drones."

> Another key factor driving robotics and AI innovation in Montreal is the city's booming gaming industry.

> Global tech leaders with offices in Montreal include Google, Meta and Microsoft.

> For businesses carrying out research and development, Montreal offers a range of generous tax credits.
