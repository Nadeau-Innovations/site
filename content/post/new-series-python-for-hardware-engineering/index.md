title: 'New Series: Python for Hardware Engineers'
---

Once upon a time, at McGill University in Mechanical Engineering, I took a course called `COMP 208 Computer Programming for Physical Sciences and Engineering`.
The goal was to give us future hardware engineers a foundation in programming, to allow us to automate, perform advanced calculations, and solve our engineering problems through code.

They taught me Fortran and C (based on the 1988 version of [The C Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language)).
They told me that these were the most important programming languages I'll ever need.
They were wrong...

As part of a new series of posts, I'll be remedying this past wrong and exploring using Python for typical hardware engineering applications and tasks.
Inspired by my own career and books like [`Automate the Boring Stuff with Python`](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/), I'll dive into using Python for such topics as:

- Temperature sensors and weather analysis
- Dashboards and data visualization
- [Robotics]({{< ref "publication/nadeau-2019-pybotics" >}}), [optimization]({{< ref "publication/nadeau-2018-evolutionary" >}}), and [metrology]({{< ref "publication/nadeau-2019-impedance" >}})
- And much more!

The objective is to bridge the gap between the needs of hardware engineers and the power that simple, day-to-day coding can unlock.
