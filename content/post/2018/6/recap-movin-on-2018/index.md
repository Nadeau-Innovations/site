Sustainable mobility was the primary topic of the event. Overall, one of my favourite quotes came from [Bertrand Piccard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Piccard):

I really enjoy the economic spin that this perspective provides.

Nudging the private sector is just an extension of this concept.
