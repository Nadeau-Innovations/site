Startups have unique challenges in the growth phase, from limited financial resources to talent shortages. One solution that has gained popularity is hiring fractional experts, such as fractional CTOs and fractional talent teams. These experts can help startups extend their financial runways and accelerate their development and growth. Here's how.

## What are Fractional Experts?

Fractional experts are professionals who work with multiple clients on a part-time basis. They bring their specialized skills and expertise to startups and other businesses without a full-time commitment.

## Fractional CTOs and Talent Teams

Fractional CTOs are experienced technology leaders who can help startups with their technology strategy and execution. They can help startups choose the right technologies and tools, build scalable systems, and manage their technology teams. Fractional talent teams are groups of experts who can help startups with their talent acquisition, development, and retention. They can provide startups with access to a diverse talent pool, from engineers to designers to marketers.

## How Fractional Experts Help Startups Grow

Startups have limited financial resources, and hiring full-time experts can be costly. Fractional experts offer startups a cost-effective way to access specialized skills and expertise. Startups can hire fractional experts for a fraction of the cost of a full-time employee, and they only pay for the services they need.

Fractional experts also help startups accelerate their development and growth. Startups often try to figure things out themselves, which can be time-consuming and costly. Fractional experts know how to build the right thing correctly and can help startups avoid expensive mistakes. They can also help startups move quickly and be more agile, essential in the fast-paced startup world.

## Extending Financial Runways

One of the biggest challenges for startups is extending their financial runways. Hiring fractional experts can help startups extend their financial runways by reducing their burn rate. As noted by Pivot + Edge in an article titled "[How to Balance Achieving Your Hiring Goals While Extending Your Financial Runway](https://www.pivotandedge.com/our-blog/how-to-balance-achieving-your-hiring-goals-while-extending-your-financial-runway/)," startups can use the money they save to invest in other business areas, such as marketing, product development, and even salaries.

Startups face many challenges in the growth phase, but hiring fractional experts can help them overcome them. Fractional experts offer startups cost-effective access to specialized skills and expertise, accelerate their development and growth, and extend their financial runways. If you're a startup founder looking to scale your business, consider hiring fractional experts to help you achieve your goals.
