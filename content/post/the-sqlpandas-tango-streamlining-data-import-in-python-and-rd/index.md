title: 'The SQL-Pandas Tango: Streamlining Data Import in Python and R&D'
---

In software R&D, efficiently loading SQL scripts in Python using [`sqlite3`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) and importing data into a [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) can be a game-changer.

Consider a scenario where you're developing an AI-driven robot for sorting food products, and your database contains various fruit and vegetable information. Data analysis and preprocessing are crucial to train the robot effectivelyâ€”this is where Python, Pandas, and SQL work seamlessly together.

## Installing Dependencies

To begin, install the necessary packages: Python, `sqlite3`, and Pandas.

The Python installation instructions can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

`sqlite3` is included in the Python standard library, so no additional installation is required.

For Pandas, install it with the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

## Create an SQLite Database

We'll create a straightforward SQLite database with a table containing fruit data for this guide. Save the SQL script below as `fruit_data.sql`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE fruits (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    weight FLOAT,
    color TEXT
);

INSERT INTO fruits (name, weight, color) VALUES ('Apple', 1.2, 'Red');
INSERT INTO fruits (name, weight, color) VALUES ('Banana', 0.2, 'Yellow');
INSERT INTO fruits (name, weight, color) VALUES ('Cherry', 0.01, 'Red');
```

## Execute the SQL Script in Python

Next, create a Python script to load the SQL script and execute it using the `sqlite3` package.

```python
import sqlite3

# load SQL script from file
with open("fruit_data.sql") as f:
    sql = f.read()

# or, load SQL script from string
sql = """
CREATE TABLE fruits (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    weight FLOAT,
    color TEXT
);

INSERT INTO fruits (name, weight, color) VALUES ('Apple', 1.2, 'Red');
INSERT INTO fruits (name, weight, color) VALUES ('Banana', 0.2, 'Yellow');
INSERT INTO fruits (name, weight, color) VALUES ('Cherry', 0.01, 'Red');
"""

# create an in-memory database
connection = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")

# execute SQL script
cursor = connection.cursor()
cursor.executescript(sql)
```

This script generates an in-memory SQLite database, reads the `fruit_data.sql` script, and executes it.

## Load Data into a Pandas DataFrame

Lastly, load data from the SQLite database into a Pandas DataFrame:

```python
import pandas as pd

 # load SQL table into a pandas DataFrame
query = "SELECT * from fruits"
df = pd.read_sql_query(
    sql=query,
    con=connection,
)
```

The generates a Pandas DataFrame from the SQL table with the following:

```bash
   id    name  weight   color
0   1   Apple    1.20     Red
1   2  Banana    0.20  Yellow
2   3  Cherry    0.01     Red
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully loaded an SQL script in Python using `sqlite3` and imported the data into a Pandas DataFrame. Mastering this skill set will undoubtedly be invaluable for data-driven projects in software R&D, allowing you to analyze, preprocess, and manipulate data swiftly.
