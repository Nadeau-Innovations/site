The fourth industrial revolution, known as Industry 4.0, is characterized by integrating technology into all production and operations. One key component is using mobile robots, sensors, and embedded artificial intelligence (AI) at the edge. These technologies are transforming traditional manufacturing processes and enabling new forms of innovation and efficiency in the workplace.

One example is the Boston Dynamics Spot robot, a quadrupedal mobile robot designed for various inspection, monitoring, and mapping tasks. The Spot robot can be equipped with multiple sensors and cameras, allowing it to collect data and perform tasks in environments that are difficult or dangerous for humans to access. Additionally, embedded AI enables the robot to make decisions and navigate autonomously, increasing efficiency and reducing the need for human intervention.

Another example is mobile robots and sensors for dynamic sensing and monitoring. This can be applied in various industries, such as construction, mining, and oil and gas. The Spot robot, for example, can be used to inspect and monitor construction sites, providing real-time data on the progress of projects and identifying potential issues before they become significant problems. This improves project management and reduces the need for human workers to be on site.

Using mobile robots, sensors, and embedded AI also enables observability in corporate innovation. This means monitoring and collecting real-time data on production processes' performance and efficiency in real-time. This can lead to insights that can be used to optimize operations, improve product quality and reduce downtime.

Integrating mobile robots, sensors, and embedded AI at the edge is transforming Industry 4.0 and enabling new forms of innovation and efficiency in the workplace. These technologies improve traditional manufacturing processes and provide new ways of monitoring, sensing, and observability in corporate innovation. Companies that adopt these technologies will be better positioned to stay ahead of the curve and thrive in today's fast-paced business environment.
