Need to reduce the file size of MP4 video files?
A [few simple FFMPEG commands](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/38380) make it easy.

This is especially useful as part of an ETL pipeline for preprocessing AI/ML data or to reduce the file size of videos for a website.

## Compression Commands

```bash
# libx265 can offer around 25â€“50% savings compared to H.264 video encoded with libx264
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vcodec libx265 -crf 28 output.mp4

# libx264 offers more compatibility, e.g., static site generators
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vcodec libx264 -crf 20 output.mp4
```

## Looping Over a Directory

Have a bunch of files that need to be compressed all at once?
Loop over a directory with the following:

```bash
for F in *.mp4; \
  do ffmpeg -i $F -vcodec libx264 -crf 24 temp.mp4 \
    && mv -f temp.mp4 $F; \
  done
```
