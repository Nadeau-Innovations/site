As a CTO in an early-stage hard tech startup, there are several vital things that you should know to be successful. These include understanding the technology, building a solid team, and staying on top of industry trends.

#### Understand the Technology

First and foremost, it is essential to have a deep understanding of the technology that your startup is working on. This means staying up-to-date on your field's latest advancements and developments and speaking intelligently about them with potential investors and partners. Additionally, you should be able to understand and communicate the technical aspects of your product or service to non-technical team members and potential customers.

#### Build a Solid Team

Another crucial aspect of being a CTO in an early-stage startup is building a solid team. This includes hiring the right people with the necessary skills and experience and creating a positive and productive work environment. It also means effectively communicating with and motivating your team members and providing them with the resources and support they need to succeed.

#### Follow Trends

In addition to understanding the technology and building a solid team, it is vital to stay on top of industry trends. This means keeping abreast of new developments and innovations in your field and being able to anticipate potential changes in the market. By staying informed, you can position your startup for success and be prepared to adapt to any changes in the industry.

#### Evolve With the Role

Finally, it is crucial for CTOs in tech startups to understand that their role will evolve. In the early stages, they may need to take on various responsibilities, including hands-on development work, due to limited personnel. While they may enjoy the technical side of things, it's important to remember that their role will involve more business and management tasks as the company grows. This means they will need to develop their people skills as communicating effectively with other departments and team members become increasingly important. They need to rely on more than books or tutorials to gain these skills. Mentorship and guidance from experienced CTOs can be incredibly valuable.

Overall, being a CTO in an early-stage, hard tech startup can be challenging but incredibly rewarding. By understanding the technology, building a solid team, staying on top of industry trends, and understanding the evolution of the role, you can set your startup up for long-term success.
