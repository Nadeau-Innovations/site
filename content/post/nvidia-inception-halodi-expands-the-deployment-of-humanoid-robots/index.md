Thrilled to have been featured by NVIDIA as part of their Inception Program.

> NVIDIA Inception program member, Halodi Robotics, expands the deployment of humanoid robots to industries such as security, logistics, healthcare, and retail.  EVE, an autonomous humanoid robot, can perform mundane, repetitive, dull or dangerous tasks. In retail environments, EVE can safely collaborate with staff, working 24/7 to restock shelves and do repetitive tasks.

> The NVIDIA Inception Program has been a vital asset and partnership towards our development of humanoid robots for the human world. I appreciate the support, contacts, and networking NVIDIA has provided. We have the opportunity to talk directly with the NVIDIA teams, engineers, product managers, and technical experts behind their incredible products, such as Isaac Sim, Omniverse, and Jetson. This direct connection and insight provide Halodi Robotics with a deep technical understanding of the products, helping us unblock any development issues and providing feedback on our architecture to ensure top technical quality.
