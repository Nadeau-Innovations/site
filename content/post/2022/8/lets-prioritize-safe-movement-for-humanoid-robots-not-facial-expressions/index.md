The biggest operational challenge for companies today: finding qualified
help at rates to keep their businesses open. The U.S. started 2022 with
a 3.8% [unemployment
rate](https://twitter.com/potus/status/1499895262864621573?s=21)
and 11 million [job
openings](https://www.bls.gov/jlt/), the widest gap in
jobs-to-available-employees in decades. The obvious answer to this
deficit for commercial security, retail operations, warehouse logistics,
and healthcare staffing is to augment the workforce with robots to
extend available human resources.

Media coverage of robots batting eyelashes and turning backflips has led
to hyperventilating headlines about robot overlord domination. But
robots don’t have to replace humans; they can be collaborative
teammates. Survey respondents in a 2020 [World
Economic Forum (WEF)
report](https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-future-of-jobs-report-2020)
“expect robots will take on more repetitive or menial tasks and leave
humans free to focus on more substantive tasks.” Scarce personnel can
prioritize complex tasks and creative functions that are ultimately more
rewarding.

## To serve humankind

The pandemic has proven to be the biggest single driver for change in
the industry, according to the [International
Federation of Robotics
(IFR)](https://ifr.org/ifr-press-releases/news/top-5-robot-trends-2021).
There’s no question that service robots can make workplaces more
efficient by performing dirty, dangerous, and dull tasks that don’t
absolutely require human intervention. In addition to warehouses and
assembly lines, robots are no longer an unusual sight in guarding office
buildings, cleaning hotels, and delivering food. Siri, Alexa, Roombas,
AVs, and other helper bots have already established a beachhead in
everyday life. Perhaps that’s why [Association
for Advancing Automation
(A3)](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/12/robots-jobs-staff-shortage-automation/)
data for 2021 shows an all-time high for North American robot orders.

But for anthropomorphic service robots to become widely accepted, they
must move and interact with humans in a way that feels relatively
natural. They need to be affordable, so the system has to be very
simple. They need to do valuable physical labour, so they have to be
very capable. They also need to exert a large force — whether lifting
things, moving things, opening heavy doors, helping someone into a
wheelchair, or pushing a trolley.

The challenge is to make them do this safely.

## Taking human shape

Service and helper robots must be capable of learning multiple tasks to
assist human beings. Their physical Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
extends far beyond fixed repetitive industrial tasks undertaken by
stationary robots. As such, they need to be able to interact with the
human world as humans do.

We must bring service robots out of the factory and integrate them into
the human world. Humans are sometimes an afterthought when designing new
“smart” facilities. But to progress and accept them, we must make them
fit into our world, not the other way around. We can’t redesign our
homes and office spaces for the robot to get from point A to B.

Robots must be designed from the ground up to be able to deal with any
object they encounter, just as a human would. A humanoid form is the
optimal design for a robot, and shaping a robot like a human allows it
to interact in the human environment as a human does. An R2D2-type robot
can’t manipulate doorknobs or reach a high shelf.

## If it looks like a human

However, a humanoid robot creates expectations, sometimes
subconsciously, of human-like behaviour. That means they must not only
be affordable and capable, but they must be intrinsically safe around
humans and comfortable, quiet, and fast.

Moreover, the closer to real life a robot becomes, the more it starts to
bother people that it isn’t quite human enough. A 1970 essay described
the [“uncanny
valley”](https://spectrum.ieee.org/what-is-the-uncanny-valley)
where a person's response shifts from empathy to revulsion as a humanoid
robot fails to attain the expected degree of lifelike appearance and
behaviour (see also
[A.I.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_19pRsZRiz4),
the 2001 Steven Spielberg film). We have reached the stage where it is
nearly impossible for humans to detect real faces from fake. A
[study](https://www.pnas.org/content/119/8/e2120481119)
in the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* concluded that
“synthesis engines have passed through the uncanny valley and are
capable of creating faces that are indistinguishable” from real ones.

Vast amounts of time, money, and personnel are currently devoted to
making humanoid robots *look* more human when the emphasis needs to be
on their *behaviour* around humans. We need to be talking more about
accountability and liability for robot safety.

This doesn’t mean that lifelike facial expressions don’t offer value for
creating stronger acceptance in socially assistive use cases where the
robot helps with intimate personal functions. Suppose humans are no
longer able to detect real faces from fakes. In that case, companies
developing anthropomorphic robots have an even greater duty to ensure
they “do no harm” regarding robot movement and behaviour.

## If it moves like a human

Until recently, most robots have been far too powerful — and therefore
dangerous — to assist humans outside of an assembly line. Because they
were designed based on [accuracy and exact
positioning]({{< ref "publication/nadeau-2019-impedance" >}}),
they haven’t been well-suited for an
[unstructured environment populated with
humans]({{< ref "publication/nadeau-2018-evolutionary" >}})
who create situations that robot programmers did not predict. Yet most
robots today are built based on the core principles of how robots behave
in a factory.

Understanding nonverbal communication is a challenge. Robots can shout
at people to move out of their way, but how do you get them to recognize
intent — and vice-versa? Human beings have evolved to have an innate
understanding of gestures and the significance of raising an arm. But
when robots move their arms around humans, we don't have the intuition
of what that arm is about to do.

Creating robots [to be aware of body contact
location is a significant pursuit in robotics
today]({{< ref "publication/nadeau-2019-towards" >}}).
It’s not a question of *whether* problems will occur; it’s *when* they
will occur. How can we ensure that when robots collide with humans — as
they will — it’s as safe as possible?

## Traditional hardware and software

Most robots aren’t safe around humans because they’re built like
machines, not humans. They move too fast and sound too loud. Traditional
robot designs require high ratio gears to achieve the force necessary
for useful work, making them dangerous, noisy, and too expensive for
everyday tasks. The torque generated for basic tasks can be enough to
injure or kill a bystander, which is why industrial robots are caged.
However, without significant gearing, off-the-shelf motors can’t produce
enough force to do the job.

Unfortunately, the world in which people learn to perform their work is
not the same world in which robots are programmed to help them. Beyond
the software code required for basic mechanical functions, service
robots need programming to help operate in unstructured environments.
Artificial intelligence and machine learning should help but often
don’t, and most AI systems live in virtual worlds working with static
data.

Traditionally, programmers collect all the data they can and then
develop a model good enough to deal with the noise in the data. That
process will always be a step behind. For service robots to provide
essential service, they need to be able to interact with — and learn
from — the same world as humans. The solution is to build robots to move
more like people and learn from them.

## Replicating humans on the inside

Robot developers must approach these hardware and software problems from
a new perspective. Rather than simply make robots that take the human
form *on the outside*, what if we could replicate the benefits of
biomechanics and sensory data input *on the inside*?

Robots must be designed from the ground up with intrinsic safety in
mind. The robot should be, like a human, incredibly good at minimizing
the amount of energy used and impact required to perform a task. This is
key to how humans walk, to how we touch things and manipulate objects.
The way of doing that is by considering everything involved, from the
motors and transmissions to the sensors, software, and AI.

In hardware, eliminating unsafe gears and hydraulics can cut costs,
reduce noise, and improve power consumption. Focusing more on
high-efficiency motor design can result in a drive system that uses very
little material, is very lightweight, and is inherently safer for robot
applications. In software, adding the ability to gather environmental
data in real-time can improve the quality of the information robots need
to learn and turn them into a self-improving product, becoming smarter
with each environment and application.

Together, these technological innovations can reimagine what a service
robot does, where it operates, and how much it costs — everything
businesses have been demanding.

## Safety first

Developing a capable, affordable, safe humanoid robot is not as simple
as Elon Musk’s [offhand
comments](https://fortune.com/2022/01/27/elon-musk-tesla-optimus-robot-labor-shortage/)
indicate. To have a genuinely safe HRI, developers must take a more
holistic approach and evaluate everything from the motor design to the
total body weight. The choices made in the initial steps of designing
the robot may have repercussions at the end application in an entirely
unforeseen way. Everything becomes part of the optimization problem of
making a better, safer robot from end to end. Robot grimaces can come
later.
