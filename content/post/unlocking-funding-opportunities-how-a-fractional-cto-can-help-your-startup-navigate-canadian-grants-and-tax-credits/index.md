Technology startups are the backbone of innovation and growth in the modern economy. However, starting a tech company can be daunting, especially for entrepreneurs who may not have a background in technology or experience with the complex and ever-evolving field of technology.

Canadian grants and tax credits (e.g., [SR&ED](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program.html), [NRC IRAP](https://nrc.canada.ca/en/support-technology-innovation)) are crucial areas where a fractional CTO and funding experts can provide valuable support to startups. A fractional CTO is a part-time chief technology officer who can provide startups with the technical expertise and guidance they need to navigate the ever-changing landscape of technology and unlock funding opportunities. Funding experts help clients leverage non-dilutive government funding to continue investing in R&D, accelerate growth, and reach business goals. As outlined below, there are many ways in which these experts can help startups access non-dilutive funding.

#### Identifying Funding Opportunities

A fractional CTO can help startups identify the Canadian grants and tax credit programs that are most relevant to their business and provide guidance on how to apply for them. Additionally, they can help startups understand the technical requirements and documentation needed to qualify for these programs. In many cases, a fractional CTO will also introduce startups to funding experts, who will lend their expertise and work with the fractional CTO to help startups discover and acquire the best government funding for their needs.

#### Working with Experts

Working with a fractional CTO can be an excellent way for startups to connect with funding experts like [R&D Partners](https://www.rdpartners.com/) and maximize their chances of receiving government funding. These experts offer customized solutions tailored to each of their client's unique needs, helping them receive up to 74% of their R&D expenditures back in the form of a refund or credit. With their in-depth knowledge of the government funding landscape, these experts can help startups identify and match with the proper grants, tax credits, loans, and other funding opportunities in Canada.

A fractional CTO can play a crucial role in this process by working closely with these funding experts to understand a startup's technology needs and R&D expenditures. By leveraging their expertise and knowledge of the funding landscape, the fractional CTO can help startups navigate the complex world of government funding and secure the resources they need to fuel growth and innovation.

“Our funding experts are always excited to work alongside fractional CTOs like [Nicholas Nadeau](https://www.linkedin.com/in/engnadeau),” said [Mike Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tmlee/), President of [R&D Partners](https://www.rdpartners.com/). “Our funding expertise synergizes well with the technical knowledge from fractional CTOs to help entrepreneurs easily find the government funding they need and empower their startups to succeed and prosper.”

#### Building a Solid Case

A fractional CTO can help startups create a compelling pitch to showcase their innovation, technology and impact to the grant providers and tax credit authorities. They can help startups identify the critical technical milestones they need to achieve to secure funding and provide guidance on how to achieve them.

#### Leveraging Technical Expertise

A fractional CTO can help startups demonstrate their technical capabilities and demonstrate how they are addressing a specific market need by guiding how to implement new technologies and trends. This can be especially important when applying for grants or tax credits focused on specific technology areas.

#### Navigating the Application Process

In collaboration, a fractional CTO and funding experts can help startups navigate the application process for Canadian grants and tax credits. They can provide the following:

- Guidance on completing the application forms.
- Scheduling meetings with funding providers.
- Preparing for any technical due diligence that may be required.

#### Coaching and Managing the Engineering Team

A fractional CTO can help startups by managing and coaching the engineering team on good R&D processes and time sheet management. This can help the team to be more productive and efficient and make the best use of their time and resources.

A fractional CTO and funding experts are valuable assets for technology startups seeking Canadian grants and tax credits. These experts can help startups create innovative products and services, secure funding, and grow their businesses by providing the technical expertise and guidance they need to navigate the complex landscape of funding opportunities.

With this support, startups can focus on what they do best - creating innovative products and services - while leaving the technical details, funding opportunities, and engineering management to the experts.
