title: Immervision Brings Human-like Vision Capabilities to Halodi Robotics
---

> Immervision today announced that Halodi Robotics AS has chosen its next-generation vision system for Halodi's humanoid service robot.

> Machine vision is sufficient for a robot to perform tasks independently, but to function with a human operator, a robot also needs an advanced vision system, it claimed.

> Halodi Robotics designs and develops humanoid robots to operate in unstructured environments where people and machines must work safely together.

> “Robots have incredible potential to expand human capabilities and performance in the real world,” says Nicholas Nadeau, CTO of Halodi Robotics. “Immervision is able to help our EVE service robots create even greater value, by allowing human operators, via a virtual reality (VR) headset, to respond with human intuition capabilities to the anomalies that may arise as robots interact with their dynamic environment.”
