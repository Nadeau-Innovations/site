  Corporate Innovation'
---

Hard tech startups and corporate innovation teams continually seek new ways to stand out and succeed. One approach that has garnered attention is the concept of "Unreasonable Hospitality," as outlined in [Will Guidara's book "Unreasonable Hospitality"](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/674289/unreasonable-hospitality-by-will-guidara/9780593418574) and related to [Danny Meyer's book "Setting the Table."](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/213280)

Companies can foster an environment that exceeds customer expectations and accelerates growth by applying this principle to tech innovation, hard tech product development, application engineering, and MVPs (Minimum Viable Products).

## What is Unreasonable Hospitality?

Unreasonable Hospitality goes beyond merely meeting customers' needs. It's about exceeding their expectations and providing exceptional experiences at every touchpoint. It is rooted in the belief that going the extra mile for your customers will create a loyal client base and inspire your team to achieve greatness.

In the context of hard tech innovation, this philosophy can be transformative, paving the way for stronger relationships, heightened creativity, and a culture of excellence.

## Implementing Unreasonable Hospitality in Hard Tech Innovation

### Be Proactive in Problem-Solving

Innovation is synonymous with problem-solving, and Unreasonable Hospitality calls for anticipating customers' needs before they know they have them. To stay ahead of the curve, teams should consistently research industry trends, gather customer feedback, and analyze data to identify potential pain points. By proactively addressing these issues, companies can provide solutions that surprise and delight their customers.

### Foster a Culture of Collaboration and Inclusivity

Unreasonable Hospitality is built upon the foundation of strong relationships. In hard tech innovation, this means fostering a collaborative and inclusive environment where diverse perspectives are valued. Encouraging open communication and teamwork will strengthen bonds within your organization and lead to more inventive solutions catering to a broader range of customers.

### Prioritize Customer-Centric MVPs

When developing MVPs, keeping the customer at the center of the process is essential. Prioritize features that address customer pain points and align with their preferences. Designing MVPs to solve real-world problems demonstrates that you understand and value your customers' needs. This approach increases the likelihood of a successful product launch and cements your reputation as a company that puts customers first.

### Go Above and Beyond in Application Engineering

In application engineering, Unreasonable Hospitality can be manifested through personalized support and a relentless commitment to quality. Take the time to understand each client's unique needs and tailor your solutions accordingly. Be meticulous in your attention to detail, ensuring that every aspect of the product or service exceeds expectations. Going the extra mile will create lasting impressions and foster long-term client relationships.

### Continuously Iterate and Improve

Unreasonable Hospitality is not a one-time event; it requires a continuous commitment to improvement. Embrace a growth mindset and be open to change. Continuously evaluate your products, services, and processes, identifying opportunities for enhancement. You demonstrate your dedication to providing exceptional customer experiences by consistently iterating and refining your offerings.
