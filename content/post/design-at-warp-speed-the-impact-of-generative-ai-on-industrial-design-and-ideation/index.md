Innovation is not limited to just new products or technologies. We can also find innovation in the way people work and approach problem-solving.

One of the latest trends in innovation is the use of generative AI for creative brainstorming and vision workshops. This new technology significantly impacts industries that rely on creative ideas for their products and services, such as industrial design.

Generative AI tools like [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com) and [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release) can help designers generate a large number of ideas in a short amount of time. This allows them to explore multiple design options and iterate quickly, essential during the ideation phase. With the help of AI, designers can work more efficiently, freeing up more time for refinement and optimization.

To understand how generative AI is changing the design industry, I spoke with Phil Nadeau, an industrial designer with extensive experience in everything from product to interior design.

#### How has using generative AI tools like Midjourney impacted your workflow?

The impact has been significant. Before, we would spend hours brainstorming and sketching out ideas. Now, we can generate hundreds of ideas in minutes. This allows us to explore possibilities and find innovative solutions to design problems. It has also sped up the ideation phase, giving us more time to refine our designs.

#### How have your interactions with stakeholders changed now that you have this tool?

...

#### How do you see generative AI impacting the design industry in the future?

It will become an essential tool for designers. As AI technology advances, it will be able to generate even more complex and nuanced design options, allowing designers to explore more creative solutions. It will also make the design process more accessible to non-designers, as AI can generate designs based on input criteria, even without a deep understanding of design principles.

## What's Next?

Generative AI tools in industrial design are just one example of how this technology can be applied to various industries for creative brainstorming and vision workshops. As we see disruption in tangential industries, this new trend may be legitimate and something to keep an eye on for long-term innovation. It may also be the harbinger of a paradigm shift in what we think is possible.

Generative AI is an exciting new trend and has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach design and problem-solving in various industries. As AI technology advances, we can expect to see more creative solutions emerge, making the design process more efficient and accessible than ever before.
