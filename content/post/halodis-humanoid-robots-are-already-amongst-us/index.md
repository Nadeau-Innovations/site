title: Halodi's Humanoid Robots Are Already Amongst Us!
---

> If you don’t believe me, try to build a humanoid robot that can compete with us on this front. The reason all of this comes to mind is that I was just chatting with someone who is on a mission to do just that—the CTO of Halodi Robotics, Nicholas Nadeau—who introduced me to EVE.

> To be honest, I’ve been setting [my wife's] expectations quite a way out in the future with respect to the availability of such robots. However, having talked to Nicholas, I’m now of the view that the future is closer than I thought.
