> Beurling was a huge part of my high school education and gave
> me the opportunity to explore everything from track and field to
> space camp. I was extremely lucky to participate in the Pearson
> Partnership Program job shadowing program which allowed me
> to discover different professions that I had not been exposed to.
> I discovered my current engineering through the job shadowing
> activities,  as  well  as  a  special  week  spent  at  Space  camp  in
> Huntsville, Alabama.
> I  am  especially  grateful  to  my  amazing  teachers.  They  inspired
> hope,  ignited  my  imagination,  and  instilled  a  lifelong  love  of
> learning!
