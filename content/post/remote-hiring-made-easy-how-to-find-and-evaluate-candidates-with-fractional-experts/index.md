title: 'Remote Hiring Made Easy: How to Find and Evaluate Candidates with Fractional
  Experts'
---

The past few years have been tough for businesses and startups, especially with the rise of remote work and the challenges that come with it.
Hiring remote talent, connecting with the right people, and effectively evaluating candidates can be difficult.

One critical challenge posed by the rise of remote work is that startups face increased competition for talent. The pool of potential candidates is much larger with remote work options, giving candidates more options beyond their local job market. As a result, it can be challenging for startups to connect with the right people and effectively evaluate candidates, making hiring remote talent a complex task.

But don't worry! Here are five tips from the team at [Pivot + Edge](https://www.pivotandedge.com/) for recruiting remotely:

#### 1) Evaluate Candidates Effectively

Instead of relying on gut instinct for hiring decisions, use candidate scorecards to compare specific skills, desirable personality traits, and qualifications. Use an ATS (applicant tracking system) like [Recruitee](https://recruitee.com/) to store your scorecard findings, measure your candidate experience, and collect data for future use. A fractional talent team can help set up these systems and processes and guide your hiring team to enable efficient interviews.

#### 2) Team Up With Influencers

Encourage your team to be active online. Their posts will provide an authentic view of your company culture, which is crucial when you don't have face-to-face meetings or office vibes to sell your company experience. Check out [Pivot + Edge's blog post for a more in-depth take on building your army of internal influencers](https://www.pivotandedge.com/our-blog/turn-your-employees-into-brand-ambassadors/).

#### 3) Make Your Message Pop

Effective messaging and copywriting is crucial for startups, as you can't rely on brand reputation to carry you through. Make it count with a personal touch that brings your company culture to life!

#### 4) Expand Your Network

In addition to LinkedIn, you can expand your job posting's reach on sites like [FlexJobs](https://www.flexjobs.com/), [We Work Remotely](https://weworkremotely.com/), and [Remote OK](https://remoteok.com/). You can also build a talent network on your most suitable social platform. Invite candidates to join through your websites and careers pages. Host a private email thread, Slack channel, Discord, VR hangout, or live social media with job postings and updates.

#### 5) Utilize a Fractional CTO

A fractional CTO is a professional who provides expertise and experience in technology and engineering but only works with your company on a part-time or project basis. You can benefit from their skills and knowledge without hiring a full-time employee. A fractional CTO can help evaluate candidates effectively, help you create personalized outreach plans and strategies to attract senior-level candidates, and help you sell the company, role, and benefits to potential senior-level candidates.

By following these tips and utilizing fractional expertise, you can find and recruit the best remote team for your startup. Don't let remote work keep you from finding the talent you need to succeed!
