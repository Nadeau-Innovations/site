    "I have a confession to make: I'm a stickler for filenames.\n",
    "I wholeheartedly believe that all filenames and paths should be [`kebab case`](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kebab_case) or [`snake case`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case).\n",
    "Spaces, capitalization, and non-alphanumeric characters drive me nuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "My obsession comes from my years of jumping back and forth between Linux (programming, servers), Windows ([CAD](https://www.solidworks.com/)), and MacOS (personal laptop), where each system has different *de facto* filename standards.\n",
    "As such, I eventually converged towards simple and draconian filenames to ensure easy data scraping when I needed to make automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, I understand there are times when this level of rigidity doesn't fully make sense.\n",
    "One example is in mechanical engineering when working with a [PDM system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_data_management) (and non-developer stakeholders).\n",
    "Common practice is to have your filenames as `<SKU> - <Part Name>.<Extension>` (e.g., `ABC123 - Big Bolt.sldprt`). \n",
    "Yes, there are spaces, but as long as the schema is enforced, the database will still be easily machine parsable.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we extend this line of thought from filenames to a generalized \"path\" or \"resource location\" (e.g., URLs, data column headings, data labels), strict and consistent schemas are import, as the devil in the details.\n",

    "And non-alphanumeric characters are evil.\n",
    "They just causes headaches for everyone.\n",

    "## Sanitize All Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "String validation and sanitization ensures that a string meets a set of criteria (validation) or modifies it to conform to a schema (sanitization).\n",
    "As discussed above, there are plenty of important situations where incoming strings (e.g., data labels, paths, filenames) may not conform to a standard and behave unexpectedly.\n",
    "As previously discussed in the [temperature and humidity data analysis post]({{< ref \"post/2020/10/python-for-hardware-engineers-analyzing-temperature-sensor-data\" >}}), the `Extract` and `Transform` steps of an [ETL workflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) typically applies some data cleaning.\n",
    "Stripping non-alphanumeric characters is a simple and useful step for many data processing applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen in [our previous post]({{< ref \"post/2020/10/python-for-hardware-engineers-analyzing-temperature-sensor-data\" >}}), the data logger tried to be fancy and used the (evil) degree symbol (`°C`) and the percent sign (`%RH`) for the temperature and humidity column headers, respectively.\n",
    "Unfortunately, this is not uncommon, and while Excel parses these strings normally, we can't always guarantee how different systems or programs will react.\n",
    "For example in LaTeX, the percent sign is the special character for comments, and thus needs to be escaped (`\\%`) else you'll have a bad day.\n",

    "Regex is truly powerful and can be used in a variety of situations and across all programming languages.\n",
    "Even though it has a relatively difficult learning curve, it's definitely something that most developers and engineers should try understand and get familiar with.\n",
    "\n",
    "However in my humble opinion, depending on the context, it's overkill.\n",

    "The problem with regex is that it's too powerful and too flexible.\n",
    "The Pythonic approaches shown above are easy to read, easy to debug, and easy to understand their scope.\n",

    "The core component of this approach is the regex pattern.\n",
    "For this example, we'll be using `\"[^0-9a-zA-Z\\s]+\"`.\n",
    "As explained by a [regex testing website](https://regexr.com/), this pattern includes the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `[^...]`: Negated set that matches any character NOT in the set\n",
    "- `0-9`: Matches numeric characters in the given range\n",
    "- `a-z`: Matches lowercase alphabetic characters in the given range\n",
    "- `A-Z`: Matches uppercase alphabetic characters in the given range\n",
