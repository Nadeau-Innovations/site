    "Design that is backed by data proves that your work is on the right track.\n",
    "It reveals the pain points, flaws, and opportunities, while unearthing new trends and improves your designs by adding objectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data collection, processing, and analysis are fundamental skills that engineers need to create effective solutions and data-driven designs.\n",
    "A big reason for this [Python for Hardware Engineers]({{< ref \"/post/2020/10/new-series-python-for-hardware-engineering\" >}}) series is because I believe that the standard educational pathways that hardware engineers follow isn't sufficient for modern data-driven practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In university, mechanical and electrical engineering lab sessions required us to collect maybe few dozen data points and produce a report.\n",
    "Even our [semi-realistic temperature and humidity data processing example using a real data logger]({{< ref \"/post/2020/10/python-for-hardware-engineers-analyzing-temperature-sensor-data\" >}}) only collected recordings at 30min intervals.\n",
    "This would only produce a few hundred recordings during a week of constant data collection, something which Excel or simple `pandas` scripts can easily handle.\n",

    "Well, I'll let you in on a little secret: 95% of the time, recording data to disk is perfectly fine for what we do.\n",

    "## Saving Data to Disk\n",
    "\n",
    "There's nothing I love more than setting up an experiment, clicking go, and watching my PC monitor the progress.\n",
    "For example, when I developed a [closed-loop robot calibration technique]({{< ref \"publication/nadeau-2019-impedance\" >}}), I sat back and watched my collaborative robot dance around for a while as my laptop recorded each robot pose and laser tracker measure.\n",

    "\n",
    "At [AON3D](https://www.aon3d.com/) we have an internal fleet of printers used for customer success, engineering, R&D, and sales.\n",
    "As an experiment and side-project, I started recording all our prototype printers' temperatures (two toolhead sensors, one chamber sensor, and one bed sensor) over time to have a better understanding of system reliability and \"hot-time\" during engineering development and testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each printer reports its temperature at a rate of 1Hz.\n",
    "I record 2s of data, per printer, every 5min to have a high-level overview of our internal fleet.\n",
    "Each week I produce over 40K recordings totaling several hundred megabytes of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, I was lazy and dumped the data to disk using the method described above.\n",
    "Each week I ran a script that consolidates the data to a CSV, such that other stakeholders can have easy access and weekly reports.\n",
    "The consolidation process took several minutes as each JSON file is loaded into memory, parsed into a `pandas` Series, concatenated into a DataFrame, and then exported. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is when data starts to get too big for saving to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Meet SQLite and `peewee`\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite is a relational database system contained in a small C library. \n",
    "In contrast to many other databases, SQLite is not a client–server engine, but rather it is embedded into the end program.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, SQLite is a library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesn’t require a separate server process.\n",
    "It's the next step after dumping to disk and allows for future growth as you can one day port the code to a larger database, like PostgreSQL.\n",
    "As a super basic overview of SQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A database can have multiple tables (think Excel workbook having multiple sheets/tabs)\n",
    "- Each table stores a set of data in rows and columns\n",
    "- Each column is a data field and has a specific type (e.g., `int`, `float`, `str`, `datetime`, `bool`)\n",
    "- Each row is an instance of data across all columns (i.e., a recording)\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, SQLite is built-in to Python, but using it directly is not necessarily too intuitive or \"Pythonic\".\n",
    "As a solution, I recommend [`peewee`](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/), a simple and small [object-relational-mapping (ORM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping).\n",
    "It has few expressive concepts to make it easy to learn and intuitive to use as a \"Pythonic\" wrapper around SQLite:\n",
