While cleaning out old git project from my PhD, I created [a repository of programming examples for the KUKA LBR iiwa](https://github.com/nnadeau/kuka-lbr-examples).

These examples cover many basic and advanced applications, such as impedance control, force conditions for collision reactions, and data logging.
I also included a few utility functions that helped in my day-to-day research and testing.

Below are a couple KUKA LBR iiwa demo videos I made back in the day:
