title: AON3D Takes Part in Code Life Ventilator Challenge to Help Ease the COVID Crisis
---

The [Code Life Ventilator Challenge](https://www.mghfoundation.com/en/), hosted by the Montreal General Hospital Foundation, brought together professionals to design a low-cost, simple, and easy-to-manufacture ventilator that can serve patients experiencing COVID-19 respiratory challenges in [a short timeframe](https://www.mghfoundation.com/en/news/ventilator-challenge-announcement-of-the-three-finalist-teams/).

> "I'm honoured to have been nominated to support the COVID-19 Code Life Ventilator Challenge. As a Montreal-born-and-trained engineer, it was a privilege to be able to give back to the community and do my part in fighting the pandemic," said Dr. Nadeau.

> "This experience has opened my eyes to the dedication, agility, and creativity of professional and hobbyist designers when faced with a global pandemic." He will continue to act as an advisor and bridge for AON3D's additive manufacturing expertise as the challenge participants bring these designs to the manufacturing stage so they can serve patients suffering from COVID-19 around the world.
