  HQ

> The Ambassador, Deirdre Kent, paid a visit to Moss, Norway, where the current production facility of our humanoid robot EVE is located. The Ambassador had the pleasure of controlling EVE’s movements through VR and enjoyed an office tour around our production and manufacturing area.

> With the accelerating growth of Halodi Robotics, many positions are opening at our Montreal headquarters, creating new job opportunities in robotics, software, AI, and engineering. In addition, as demand for humanoid robots grows, scaling production outside of Norway may create additional new opportunities in Canada. During the visit, our CTO and the Ambassador had a brief conversation on building a strong basis for moving the Canadian-Halodi ties forward.

> "Montreal is the ideal location for the next phase of Halodi's growth. It's a hotspot for highly skilled talent, Canada’s largest center of university research, strategically located in northeastern North America, home to the largest concentration of high-tech jobs in Canada, and Montréal is known for its cosmopolitan atmosphere and quality of life." Nicholas Nadeau, CTO of Halodi Robotics, said.
