The Seattle Robotics Society was formed in 1982 to serve those interested in building robots and learning about associated technologies. We are a non-profit entity consisting of a diverse group of technologists and tinkerers. Our collective passion is to learn about robots and freely share our skills, knowledge, and experience with the greater interested community through meetings, workshops, contests, outreach events, online activities, educational activities, and mentoring.
