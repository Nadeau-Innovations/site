The role of the STEM Department is to clearly define and communicate well-rounded education as it relates to the state curriculum (TEKS and Endorsements) and provide opportunities for students and teachers to participate in department-related events collaboratively with community members, such as engineering organizations, higher education institutions, technical institutions, industry partners, and informal partners. In addition, the Mathematics, Science and Wellness, Computer Science & Technology, Career & Technical Education, Career Institutes, Enviromental Education Center, and Health & Physical Education departments are responsible for providing content district professional development and campus support.

Dallas ISD is also home to The Largest STEM EXPO in Texas where students explore, design, and create real-world STEM activites.

The Dallas ISD STEM EXPO has over 180 hands-on exhibits and serves as the culmination event for our District Championships: Science & Engineering Fair, VEX and First Robotics Competitions, First Lego Leagues, Mathematics Video Game Challenge, Mathematics Bridge Building Competition, Health and Wellness Awareness, Digital Media Fair Competition, and the Coding Club Competition.
