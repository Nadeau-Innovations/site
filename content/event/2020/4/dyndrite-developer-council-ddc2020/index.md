## A Global 2-Day Additive Manufacturing Virtual Event

Join leaders in the AM industry as they reveal new initiatives, products, and real-world accomplishments defining the digital age of manufacturing.

## The Next-Generation of Additive Manufacturing is Upon Us

Evidenced by our current situation and the life saving response of the additive manufacturing community - it is no longer business as usual.

Additive manufacturing with its ability to instantly adapt to delivering parts into a disrupted supply chain is now a life saving narrative - putting even more importance on the ingenuity and vitality of our industry.

Engage with Dyndrite and Developer Council members as we host the first ever DDC2020 - a global virtual event connecting enterprise AM users, buyers, and members of the press, with 3D printer manufacturers and software vendors delivering tomorrowâ€™s digital manufacturing solutions.
