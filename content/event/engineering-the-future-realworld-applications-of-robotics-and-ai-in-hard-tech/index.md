Desjardins and IEEE Concordia are happy to present a new edition of Lunch and Learn! 

Robotics and AI are at the forefront of hard tech applications and are central to the next generation of innovation.

In this presentation, we will explore real-world applications of robotics and AI through examples of unique technologies in the biomedical, food robotics, humanoid robotics, Industry 4.0, and additive manufacturing domains. Using examples from Nicholas’ career, we will highlight the potential of robotics and AI in solving complex problems and streamlining workflows in the hard tech sector.

This event is free and food will be served.
