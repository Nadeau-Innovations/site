I'm excited to be taking part at [ENGCOMM 2023](https://www.engcomm.ca/) as a judge!

ENGCOMM is a leading global initiative that fosters interdisciplinary collaboration between engineering and business students. This is a one-of-a-kind opportunity that allows students to engage in a unique learning experience before they start their professional careers.

I am thrilled to support the next generation of engineers and entrepreneurs as they develop and showcase their skills through this program. ENGCOMM is the first of its kind, combining the technical and interactive fields of engineering and commerce to provide students with a truly innovative learning experience.

With over 13 sponsors and 35 universities from around the world, ENGCOMM offers many insightful social events and unique experiences. Through sharpened skills and heightened expertise, students are given a chance to solve real-life industry problems by putting their classroom knowledge to the test.

I'm honoured to be part of such a groundbreaking initiative. I look forward to witnessing the innovative solutions emerging from this competition. Congratulations to all participants, and thank you, ENGCOMM, for giving students this valuable opportunity to showcase their skills and expertise.
