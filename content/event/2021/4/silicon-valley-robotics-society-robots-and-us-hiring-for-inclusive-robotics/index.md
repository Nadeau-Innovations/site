Silicon Valley Robotics (SVR) is continuing the conversation about important robotics topics and socio-technical issues.
SVR is inviting domain experts and interesting thinkers to discuss topics relating to robotics innovation, commercialization and inclusivity.

I'll be sharing my thoughts about inclusive robotics:
What is it?
Why do we need it?
And what do we do to get it?

Moderated by [Andra Keay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andra-keay/) of [Silicon Valley Robotics](https://svrobo.org/).

Guest speakers:

- Kerri Fetzer-Borelli, TRI
- Ariel Anders, Robust AI
