## IEEE EMBS, VIT Vellore

IEEE EMBS at VIT provides its members with access to the people, practices, information,
ideas, and opinions that are shaping one of the fastest-growing fields in science. It presents a
forum for like-minded individuals of the various IEEE communities to exchange ideas covering
healthcare along with technology in multidisciplinary fields.
Our members take a step closer to make science fiction a little less fiction by designing
prosthetic limbs and artificial organs or regenerate tissue. They also create drug formulations,
develop pharmaceuticals or collect and analyze biological data, among other work. We also aim
to inculcate a spirit of inquisitiveness in science amongst students through seminars and
workshops. We provide them an opportunity to enhance their technical skills and
problem-solving abilities by conducting intriguing technical events. Dedicated volunteers, as a
part of the Executive Committee of the Section as well as the Chapters continuously strive to
bring more activities under this community paving the way for a joyful ride to futuristic science.
