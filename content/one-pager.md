        ## What We Do

        Nadeau Innovations helps companies build next-generation technologies and empowers high-performance teams through fractional CTO services.

        We work with our clients as strategic partners in their innovation initiatives and provide an efficient solution to stay ahead of the curve in the competitive and fast-paced technology landscape. Nadeau Innovations brings expertise, flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and an independent perspective, which is invaluable for innovation development.

        As a strategic partner, Nadeau Innovations supports both corporate innovation and startups in their technology development journey. Companies can benefit from the expertise and experience of a seasoned technology professional without the expense and commitment of a full-time hire.

        #### Corporate Innovation

        Corporate innovation initiatives are becoming increasingly important for companies of all sizes as the business landscape becomes increasingly competitive and technology advances rapidly. However, many companies need help with how to approach innovation in a way that is both effective and efficient. Fractional CTO services provide technical guidance and leadership for established companies to tap into new markets, stay relevant, and build an agile culture of innovation and experimentation.

        #### Startups

        Startups face unique challenges as they navigate the early stages of growth and development. One solution to these challenges is to bring on a fractional CTO, who will provide guidance and support in product development, technology strategy, team management, and fundraising. A fractional CTO is a hands-on leader who can execute the company's vision and mission and help lead the engineering organization to deliver innovative products. Their flexibility comes from their ability to work with the company's existing leadership and team and switch between tactical and strategic approaches.

        ## How We Work

        We offer three packages for our fractional CTO services:

        1. **Innovate**: Empower the team with flexible access to expertise and strategic advising through a bank of hours retainer.
        2. **Execute**: Enable agile projects, development, and operations with consistent weekly sessions at a flat monthly rate.
        3. **Accelerate**: Embed support as part of the team to boost performance and achieve milestones at an hourly rate (minimum commitment of 32 hours per month).

        Non-retainer packages start with a three-month commitment and then switch to month-to-month with a 30-day notice for pauses or cancellations.

        ## Why Work With Nadeau Innovations

        Nadeau Innovations is led by Nicholas Nadeau. As CTO and engineering leader, he has spent the last decade creating unique technologies at the cutting edge of hardware and software systems, such as:

        - [Humanoid robotics, VR/AR/XR teleoperation, AI perception, and AGI]({{< ref "project/halodi/" >}})
        - [Collaborative robotics and computer vision for Industry 4.0 and dynamic sensing]({{< ref "project/osedea/" >}})
        - [Industrial 3D printing, additive manufacturing, and IIoT]({{< ref "project/aon3d/" >}})
        - [Food robotics]({{< ref "project/ypc/" >}})
        - [Biomedical, neuroimaging, and surgical robotics]({{< ref "project/rogue/" >}})

        Nicholas is a professional engineer (P.Eng.) and a member of the Ordre des ingénieurs du Québec (OIQ). He received his Ph.D. from École de technologie supérieure. His research combined machine learning and collaborative robotics to develop [safe robotic freehand medical ultrasound methods](https://espace.etsmtl.ca/id/eprint/2461/). Nicholas is actively involved in the Montréal startup community, being a mentor at several accelerators, including [NextAI](https://www.nextcanada.com/next-ai/), [Techstars](https://www.techstars.com/), [Creative Destruction Lab](https://creativedestructionlab.com/locations/montreal/), and [FounderFuel](https://founderfuel.com/).
