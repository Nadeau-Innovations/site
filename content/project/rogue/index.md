[Rogue Research](https://www.rogue-research.com/) specializes in medical devices, offering innovative and practical tools to help neuroscience, neurology, and psychiatric researchers achieve their goals. Their flagship product, the Brainsight navigator, is utilized in thousands of labs worldwide to enhance transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), focused ultrasound, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and veterinary neurosurgery applications.

Elevate TMS, their cutting-edge device, revolutionizes non-invasive brain stimulation by offering unprecedented control over TMS pulse parameters that significantly impact neuromodulation.

Their veterinary microsurgical robot leverages computer vision, high-resolution brain imaging, and a high-precision robot to extend the capabilities of image-guided neurosurgery for high-accuracy applications.

Nicholas Nadeau spearheaded the development of the groundbreaking robotic veterinary neurosurgery system, which included trajectory generation algorithms, computer vision, and hardware design. Additionally, he developed multiple biomedical devices and systems for TMS, NIRS, deep brain stimulation (DBS), and image-based neuronavigation.
