[Rogue Research](https://www.rogue-research.com/) is a medical device company that develops innovative and practical tools used by neuroscience, neurology, and psychiatric researchers to achieve their research goals. Their Brainsight navigator is used in thousands of laboratories worldwide to improve the application of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), focused ultrasound, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and veterinary neurosurgery.

The Elevate TMS device opens new avenues in non-invasive brain stimulation by giving you control over more parameters in the TMS pulse that fundamentally influence the nature of neuromodulation.

Their veterinary microsurgical robot uses computer vision, high-resolution brain imaging, and a high-precision robot to extend the utility of image-guided neurosurgery in high-accuracy applications.

Nicholas Nadeau led the development of the novel robotic veterinary neurosurgery system, including trajectory generation algorithms, computer vision, and hardware design. He also developed several biomedical devices and systems for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), and image-based neuronavigation.
