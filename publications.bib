  abstract	= {This paper presents a closed-loop calibration approach
		  using impedance control. The process is managed by a data
		  communication architecture based on open-source tools and
		  designed for adaptability. The calibration procedure uses
		  precision spheres and a kinematic coupling standard machine
		  tool components, which are suitable for harsh industrial
		  environments. As such, the required equipment is low cost
		  (approximately $2000 USD), robust, and is quick to set up,
		  especially when compared to traditional calibration
		  devices. As demonstrated through an experimental study and
		  validated with a laser tracker, the absolute accuracy of
		  the KUKA LBR iiwa robot was improved to a maximum error of
		  0.990 mm, representing a 58.4% improvement when compared to
		  the nominal model. Further testing showed that a
		  traditional calibration using a laser tracker only improved
		  the maximum error by 58 &micro;m over the impedance control
		  approach.},
